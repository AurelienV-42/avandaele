Freelance since 2018 and Founder of a startup, specialized in React Native. I've collaborated on more than 30 diverse Mobile and Web projects.

Graduate of Epitech and later a professor at the same school, I can help your teams continuously improve.

- **React Native Expertise**: Building smooth, performant, and maintainable apps (iOS/Android).
- **Modern Web**: Next.js / React stack for scalable products.
- **Rigorous UI/UX**: A designer's eye with Figma expertise for pixel-perfect integrations.

### 🤖 The "Plus" That Makes the Difference: AI & Automation

- **Business Automation**: Setting up workflows (n8n) to simplify your business processes.
- **Boosted Productivity**: I use the latest tools (Cursor, Claude Code) to code faster and reduce your development costs.
