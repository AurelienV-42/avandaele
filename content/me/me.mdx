## Welcome here!

If you are here it's because you're interested with my profile, so first of all thank you.

Here, I will explain who I am, what I can do and why I can be useful for your company.

## Studies

I've done studies in IT, a master degree at [Epitech](https://TODO) Lille in France.
I've learnt a lot during this school, in IT with a lot of languages (C, C++, Python, Java, JS, React, React Native, Flutter...), paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
But also how to work with a group, with big projects like [Gesture](https://avandaele.fr/projects/gesture). I've also done more than 10 hackathons which was so nice.

During my second year at Epitech, in 2018, I've started freelance. I've started to profesionnaly work with React and React Native, I've worked with more than 20 companies now, start-ups, big companies...

By experience, I now can help with design. I know everything of Figma and I'm passionate of UX/UI. I've done projects where I've done 100% of the design and my clients has always been happy with it. You can see some of design I've done [here](https://avandaele.fr/projects).

## Digital Nomad

I am actually probably traveling. Since 2023 october, I am traveling around the world. I am writing this in Jakarta, Indonesia. I try to avoid as much as possible the plane so I am maybe in trains, bus, walking or doing hitchiking.

I can be full time for your company, I just need a bit of organization and to know when you will need me, but no worries I'm way more productive and better for your company as a digital nomad.

## Sport

Are you a fan of sports? Cause I am. I've done :
- 10 years of tennis
- 5 years of basketball
- A lot of biking to train for triathlon
- Running
- Musculation

Bring me a project about sports or propose me to play some sports and I'd be really happy :)
