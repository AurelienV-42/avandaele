## 📍Location

I am probably traveling at the moment. Since October 2023, I have been traveling around the world. I am writing this in Jakarta, Indonesia. I try to avoid planes as much as possible, so I might be on trains, buses, walking, or hitchhiking.
I can work full-time for your company; I just need a bit of organization and to know when you will need me, but don't worry, I'm way more productive and beneficial for your company as a digital nomad
