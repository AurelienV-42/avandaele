## Welcome here!

If you are here, it's because you're interested in my profile, so first of all, thank you.

Here, I will explain who I am, what I can do, and why I can be useful for your company.

## Studies

I completed studies in IT, a master's degree at [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu/) Lille in France.
I learned a lot during this school, about IT with a variety of languages (C, C++, Python, Java, JS, React, React Native, Flutter...), and paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
But also, how to work in a group, on big projects like [Gesture](https://web.facebook.com/ProjetGesture/?_rdc=1&_rdr). I've also participated in more than 10 hackathons, which were really enjoyable.

During my second year at Epitech, in 2018, I started freelancing. I began to work professionally with React and React Native, and I've worked with more than 20 companies now, including startups and large corporations...

Through experience, I can now assist with design. I know everything about Figma and am passionate about UX/UI. I've completed projects where I've done 100% of the design, and my clients have always been satisfied with it. You can see some of the designs I've done [here](https://avandaele.fr/projects)..

## Digital Nomad

I am probably traveling at the moment. Since October 2023, I have been traveling around the world. I am writing this in Jakarta, Indonesia. I try to avoid planes as much as possible, so I might be on trains, buses, walking, or hitchhiking.

I can work full-time for your company; I just need a bit of organization and to know when you will need me, but don't worry, I'm way more productive and beneficial for your company as a digital nomad.

## Sport

Are you a fan of sports? Because I am. I've done:
- 10 years of tennis
- 5 years of basketball
- A lot of biking to train for triathlon
- Running
- Musculation

Bring me a project about sports or invite me to play some sports, and I'd be really happy :)
