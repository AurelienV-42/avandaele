      text: "I started with Aurélien during a crisis period which he managed and understood very well. After a bad experience with two developers who suddenly left a project at launch, I found myself on Malt, and Aurélien was able to quickly and effectively find the necessary tools to get my mobile app project back on track. I hope to continue working alongside him, and I believe he will be very competent for the upcoming (ongoing) and future missions. Aurélien is very competent, professional, responsive, and proactive. Entrusting him with a large-scale project is not a problem, his organization is very well structured. A big thank you, Aurélien! I recommend him wholeheartedly.",

I worked on an urgent React Native project for Anaïs, a dynamic content creator. Here's a quick rundown of my approach:

**Project Management**: Streamlined project workflow using Notion and Kanban boards to hit tight deadlines.

**Code Review**: Evaluated the existing codebase to efficiently plan for app deployment on Apple and Google Play Stores.

**Testing**: Conducted tests via TestFlight and Play Console to ensure a bug-free user experience.

**UX/UI Redesign**: Revamped the app's design for improved user interaction and navigation, including optimizing Figma layouts and prototyping.

**React Native Development**: Performed a comprehensive overhaul of both frontend and backend, introducing new features like an updated Tab Bar, photo upload capability, and a calendar function.

This project was a fast-paced yet rewarding challenge, culminating in a successful app launch and an ongoing collaboration with Anaïs for future enhancements.
