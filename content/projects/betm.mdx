My tenure at a dynamic start-up involved taking substantial responsibility for a project, where I had the opportunity to:

**Conceptualize**: Bringing innovative ideas to the forefront to address user needs effectively.
**Design (Figma)**: Crafting intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces to enhance user experience.
**Develop/Refactor**: Implementing and refining code to improve app performance and functionality.
**Project Management (Asana)**: Coordinating tasks and timelines to ensure project milestones were met successfully.
