I developed and launched **Dicti**, an innovative app designed to fill a significant gap in the market—there simply weren't any modern, high-performing dictation apps available on the App Store or Play Store. Here’s how I approached the project:

**Full Project Ownership**: I took charge of the entire project, from initial concept to final deployment. This included everything from design and UX/UI to backend and frontend development.

**Design**: I crafted a user-friendly and visually appealing interface using Figma, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. The design was tailored to meet the needs of users looking for a clean, intuitive app to improve their dictation skills.

**React Native Development**: I built the app from the ground up using React Native, handling both the frontend and backend. Key features include a modern Tab Bar, interactive dictation sessions, and detailed performance tracking, all optimized for both iOS and Android platforms.

**App Store and Play Store Deployment**: I navigated the complexities of deploying on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, ensuring a smooth and timely launch. This involved rigorous testing using TestFlight and Play Console to guarantee a bug-free experience.

**Market Need Fulfillment**: The creation of **Dicti** directly addressed the lack of effective dictation apps on the market, providing users with a tool that’s not only functional but also modern and user-centric.

This project was a comprehensive endeavor, and I’m proud to have brought **Dicti** to life, filling a crucial gap in the app market and setting a new standard for dictation apps.
