Circular, an innovative start-up in the wearable technology sector, has developed connected rings equipped with biosensors. These rings, paired with a mobile application, analyze body signals to improve sleep, physical activity, and overall health of the user.

In this mission, here are my key contributions:

**Development in React Native**: I actively participated in the ongoing development of their mobile application, focusing on enhancing existing features and adding new capabilities.

**Launching on the App Store**: I assisted Circular in a crucial step by preparing and launching their application on the App Store, thus ensuring increased accessibility for iPhone users."
