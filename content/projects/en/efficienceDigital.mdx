# CTO

Efficience Digitale, a specialized agency in technological innovations, entrusted me with the responsibility of contributing to the optimization of their React Native projects. Here are the main tasks I carried out:

**Code Audit**: I conducted a thorough audit to identify and assess existing technical debt, thereby guiding future development efforts.

**Project Management**: I managed four distinct projects, using tools such as Trello and Notion for effective organization and tracking.

**UX/UI Redesign**: My role also included redesigning the user experience and interface, focusing on improving the ergonomics and aesthetics of the applications.

**Refactoring and Development**: I worked on reorganizing existing code to enhance performance and maintainability and also developed new features, such as multilingual support and an offline version.

**Testing**: To ensure the reliability and robustness of the applications, I implemented effective testing strategies.
