Migrating Epsor’s Web App to a Unified React Native Web Platform

I partnered with Epsor — to modernize their product by transitioning from a classic ReactJS/NextJS stack to a unified React Native Web architecture.

🚀 Key outcomes of this mission:
• Design system migration to React Native
Rebuilt and adapted their existing design system to deliver a seamless, consistent experience across both web and mobile platforms.
• Expo & CI/CD setup
Integrated third-party services and established robust CI/CD pipelines using Expo EAS to streamline builds and deployments.
• Team upskilling & empowerment
Trained and coached their internal web teams to master React Native Web and Expo, ensuring they stay autonomous and future-proof.

🎯 Result:
Epsor now benefits from a modern, high-performance, and scalable application — with their dev teams aligned around a single, unified tech stack ready to evolve with their business.
