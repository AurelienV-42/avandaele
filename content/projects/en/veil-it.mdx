As **Founder & CTO**, I designed and developed **Veil-it** from the ground up. It is a B2B SaaS solution enabling CISOs and DPOs to secure and ensure compliance when employees use Generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).

**The Challenge:**

To address the rise of "Shadow AI" in the corporate world, where employees use public AI tools without protection. The goal was to build a bridge between productivity (AI) and security (GDPR/Confidentiality).

**Key Achievements:**

- **Architecture & Security (Security by Design)**: Designed a "Zero Trust" infrastructure where confidentiality is paramount. Implemented advanced encryption protocols and data anonymization to guarantee strict GDPR compliance against public AI models.

- **Fullstack Development & Browser Extension**: Built a complete technical ecosystem including a complex **Chrome Extension** (Manifest V3, real-time flow interception) and a high-performance multi-tenant Admin Dashboard.

- **"Product-Centric" Approach & Agility**: Managed the product roadmap, implemented robust CI/CD for zero-downtime deployments, and executed rapid iterations based on real user insights (Customer Feedback Loop).

This experience confirms my expertise in transforming a risky technological challenge (AI in enterprise) into a reliable, maintainable, and immediately operational software solution.

**Tech Stack:** React (Extension & Dashboard), NestJS, PostgreSQL, Docker, CI/CD, Stripe Integration.
