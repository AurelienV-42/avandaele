During my Master's at Epitech, I had the opportunity to be a mentor for six months. This allowed me to oversee an entire class, specifically the first-year students experiencing the famous "pool" session. I've always wanted to be a teacher and have a deep love for pedagogy. This experience is very important to me; I learned a lot about myself through it.
