My three-year final project was Gesture, with the goal of making live content (conferences, live broadcasts) accessible to the hearing impaired. Through this project, I had the opportunity to learn:
- Professional teamwork
- Pitch creation
- Marketing, persona creation, need definition
- The startup environment and fundraising
- 3D modeling and animation

We were finalists in the European Enactus competition.
