I had the opportunity to develop a banking app for international model Patrick Nodanche, designed to support ecological associations. Here's the essence of my work:

**Strategic Advisory**: Guided the product strategy to align the app with both ecological goals and business objectives.

**UX Design (Figma)**: Crafted an intuitive and appealing user interface for a seamless user experience.

**Architecture & Tools**: Established a robust architecture and selected the right tools for efficient project development.

**Front-End Development (React Native & NextJS)**: Built the user interface for both the mobile app and back office, ensuring optimal user interaction and management.

**Back-End Development (NodeJS, Express, MongoDB)**: Developed a sturdy backend for secure data and transaction management.

This project was a perfect blend of technology and ecological commitment, resulting in a product that not only meets commercial standards but also supports a greater cause.
