# DÃ©veloppeur Front - React Native

MindDay, a company dedicated to promoting mental well-being within teams (the project was B2B and changed for B2C), entrusted me with the frontend development of their web application. This mission offered me the opportunity to leverage and enhance my technical skills in the following areas:

**Storybook**: I used this tool to develop UI components in an isolated and interactive manner, thereby improving the design's consistency and quality.

**TypeScript**: I deepened my knowledge and practice of TypeScript, which helped to strengthen the reliability and maintainability of the code.

**React Navigation**: I worked on implementing efficient and intuitive navigation solutions to enhance the user experience on the application.

**React Native Web**: I utilized this extension of React Native to create a unified and responsive user experience across web platforms.
