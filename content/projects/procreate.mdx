For Procreate, a Danish company based in Copenhagen, I was tasked with creating a web dashboard for managing electricity consumption in one of their client's buildings. Here are the key aspects of my work:

**Web UX/UI Design (Figma)**: I designed an intuitive and visually appealing web interface to facilitate the visualization and management of electricity consumption.

**Organization and Documentation (Notion)**: I structured the project by defining requirements and documenting the process to ensure smooth and organized progression.

**Front-End Development (NextJS)**: I developed the front-end of the dashboard, focusing on responsiveness and user experience.

**Back-End Development (Firebase Auth, Firestore)**: I set up a secure and efficient backend infrastructure for data management and user authentication.
