I supported Skin Easy, a facial care institute, in the design and complete development of their new mobile application, connecting a modern infrastructure to their existing e-commerce platform (PrestaShop).

This mission enabled Skin Easy to:

**Backend Development**: Design of a robust API using NestJS & Prisma, translating complex business rules (skin diagnosis, ingredient incompatibilities) to generate customized skincare routines.

**Creating a Unified Experience (React Native)**: Development of the mobile application (iOS/Android via Expo) including a tracking journal (Sleep, Diet, Skin). Using React Native Web to make a critical page available on the website with the same codebase.

This mission provided Skin Easy with a proprietary and scalable loyalty tool, centralizing all business intelligence in a single API serving both Web and Mobile.

**Tech Stack**: React Native (Expo), React Native Web, NestJS, Prisma, MySQL, PrestaShop (Integration).
